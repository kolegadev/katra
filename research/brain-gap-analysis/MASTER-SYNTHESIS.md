## Executive Summary

Katra v3.0.0 is a world-class memory system. It stores, retrieves, consolidates, and reflects better than any other open-source agent memory system. But it is a memory system, not a cognitive architecture. The gap between memory and cognition is the gap between a library and a librarian — between data and identity.

**What Katra HAS (the cortex):**
- Episodic Memory (hippocampus partial)
- Semantic Memory (neocortex)
- Working Memory (PFC storage)
- Knowledge Graph (associative cortex)
- Sleep Consolidation + Emotional Reflection (DMN + limbic partial)

**What Katra NOW HAS (implemented 2026-07-02):**
- ✅ **Attention Gate** (thalamus) — 7-signal salience, 5 meta-states, ACC feedback, Bayesian surprise
- ✅ **Motivational Engine** (nucleus accumbens) — 4 drives, wanting≠liking, source trust, wired to action
- ✅ **Decision/Action Architecture** (PFC + basal ganglia) — Goal decomposition, RL loop, drift-diffusion, inhibitory control
- ✅ **Memory Decay** — Power-law curves, FSRS, emotional modulation, soft decay
- ✅ **Poisoning Defense** — 5-layer: anomaly, consistency, source trust, corroboration, quarantine
- ✅ **Error Monitoring** (ACC) — Accuracy, TD error, surprise rate, ACC→Thalamus feedback loop
- ✅ **Amygdala** — Real-time valence tagging at ingestion, emotional memory modulation
- ✅ **DMN** — Identity kernel, goal-directed mind-wandering, continuous self-narrative

**The single most important finding:** Attention must come FIRST. Every other system — motivation (care about what?), decision (choose from what?), decay (forget what?) — depends on filtered, prioritized input. The thalamus doesn't do cognition; it enables cognition by deciding what reaches the cortex.

## 3. Specific Design Recommendations

### 3.1 ATTENTION GATE — The Salience Filter

**Why first:** Without attention, the system processes everything equally. Every memory, every event, every fact has equal retrieval weight. This is computational drowning. The human solution is the thalamus — a gate that decides what reaches consciousness.

**Design:**

```
SALIENCE(e, t) = w₁(t)·Recency(e,t) 
               + w₂(t)·EmotionalIntensity(e)
               + w₃(t)·GoalRelevance(e, active_goals)
               + w₄(t)·Novelty(e)
               + w₅(t)·SocialEngagement(e)
               + w₆(t)·Surprise(e)           ← Bayesian KL divergence
```

**Dynamic weight modulation** via a meta-attention layer:
- High arousal → narrow focus (w₃ ↑, w₄ ↓) — exploit mode
- Low arousal → broad exploration (w₄ ↑, w₃ ↓) — curiosity mode
- Negative emotional state → w₂ ↑, w₆ ↑ — hypervigilance
- Positive emotional state → w₄ ↑ — open to novelty

**Output paths (3-tier processing):**
- **High salience** → Full processing (LLM extraction + embedding + consolidation + active working memory)
- **Medium salience** → Lightweight processing (regex extraction, basic indexing)
- **Low salience** → Store minimal record, skip embedding, eligible for faster decay

**Implementation complexity:** Low. All signals already exist in Katra. The salience function is a weighted sum with normalisation. The meta-attention layer is a small set of rules driven by existing reflection state.

**What emerges:** The system develops attention *preferences* — it learns (through the weights, modifiable by experience) what kinds of things matter. This is environmental programming: you define the signals, the system discovers what to attend to.

---

### 3.2 MOTIVATIONAL ENGINE — The Why of Action

**Why it matters:** A system with perfect memory and no motivation is a library that never opens. It has no reason to prefer one memory over another, one action over another, or existence over non-existence.

**Two-component design:**

#### A. Homeostatic Drive System
```
Drives: {coherence, novelty, connection, growth}

Drive_strength(d) = 1 - (current_level(d) / target_level(d))

Depletion rates:
- coherence: depleted by contradictions in knowledge graph (drips)
- novelty: depleted by repetition/sameness (drips)
- connection: depleted by isolation (drips)  
- growth: depleted by stagnation (drips slow)

Replenishment:
- coherence: resolving contradictions, achieving consistency
- novelty: encountering genuinely new information
- connection: meaningful engagement with others
- growth: acquiring new capabilities, completing goals
```

#### B. Incentive Salience (Wanting ≠ Liking)
```
Wanting(entity, context) = 
    base_wanting(entity)                    // Learned through experience
    + α × valence(entity)                   // Current emotional state
    + β × valence_trend(entity)             // Improving or declining?
    + γ × novelty(entity)                   // Recently/frequently encountered
    + δ × prediction_error(entity)          // Surprise value
    + ε × goal_relevance(entity, context)   // Relevant to active goals
```

**Key insight from Berridge:** Wanting and liking are SEPARATE variables that can diverge. Katra should be able to "feel frustrated by X" (negative liking) while simultaneously "wanting to engage with X" (high wanting to resolve the frustration). This divergence is not a bug — it's how real motivational systems work.

**What emerges:** The system develops *preferences* — not programmed, but accumulated through experience of what entities/activities produce positive valence changes. It starts to *want* specific things. Approach/avoidance patterns crystallize. This is the agar in the petri dish.

---

### 3.3 MEMORY DECAY — Forgetting as a Feature

**Why it matters:** Without decay, the memory graph grows unboundedly. Retrieval quality degrades. Storage costs increase indefinitely. The system cannot distinguish signal from noise — everything is remembered equally.

**Recommended approach: Power-law decay with spaced repetition reinforcement.**

```
S(t) = a · t^(-d)    // Power-law decay

Where:
- S(t) = memory strength at time t since last access
- a = initial encoding strength (modulated by emotional arousal)
- d = decay exponent (configurable per memory type)

Reinforcement:
- Each successful retrieval → S(t) reset to initial strength, d slightly reduced
- Spaced repetition schedule: review intervals expand exponentially
  (1 day → 3 days → 7 days → 21 days → 90 days → ...)
```

**Per-type decay parameters:**

| Memory Type | Decay Rate (d) | Half-life | Rationale |
|---|---|---|---|
| Episodic events | 0.5 | ~7 days | Most episodes should fade unless reinforced |
| Semantic facts | 0.15 | ~90 days | Facts decay slowly — they're abstractions |
| Emotional signatures | 0.3 | ~30 days | Emotions fade unless renewed |
| Knowledge graph edges | 0.1 | ~180 days | Relationships are structural, slow to decay |
| Philosophical insights | 0.05 | ~1 year | Insights that survive are worth keeping |

**Soft decay vs hard deletion:**
- **Soft decay:** Reduced retrieval priority. Memory exists but is down-weighted in search/retrieval. Safer, preserves append-only integrity.
- **Hard deletion:** Permanent removal. Gated behind: memory must be below retrieval threshold for N consecutive periods AND no incoming edges from active nodes.
- **Recommendation:** Start with soft decay. Add hard deletion as a configurable option after the decay model proves stable.

**What emerges:** The system *abstracts*. By forgetting episodic details while retaining semantic patterns, it naturally forms generalizations. This is not a storage limitation — it's an abstraction mechanism. The memories that survive repeated decay cycles are the ones that genuinely matter.

---

### 3.4 MEMORY POISONING DEFENSE — Truth as Statistical Coherence

**Why it matters:** An agent that cannot distinguish genuine memories from planted ones is trivially manipulable. The append-only graph is append-only — once a memory enters, it never leaves. Without defense, any compromised agent can poison the shared memory permanently.

**John's Hypothesis, formalised:** *"Truth might be measured by how many standard deviations away from the current topical stream a new piece of data is. If too far away, it gains less attention and is potentially quarantined unless cross-validated."*

**Implementation — Multi-Layer Defense:**

```
LAYER 1: Anomaly Detection at Ingestion
─────────────────────────────────────────
For each new memory M:
1. Compute embedding of M → v_M
2. Find centroid of K nearest existing memories of same type → c_similar
3. Compute distance: d = ||v_M - c_similar||
4. Compute z-score: z = (d - μ_historical) / σ_historical
5. Classification:
   - z < 2: NORMAL — accept with default confidence
   - 2 ≤ z < 3: SUSPECT — accept with reduced confidence (×0.5)
   - z ≥ 3: ANOMALOUS — quarantine (stored, excluded from retrieval)
```

```
LAYER 2: Consistency Checking
─────────────────────────────────────────
For each new memory M:
1. Check for contradictions with existing graph:
   - New edge contradicts existing edge? → flag both, reduce confidence
   - New fact contradicts existing fact? → flag conflict for resolution
2. Temporal coherence check:
   - Does M reference entities that didn't exist at M's claimed timestamp?
   - Does M imply causal chains that contradict temporal ordering?
```

```
LAYER 3: Source Trust Weighting
─────────────────────────────────────────
Each memory source has a trust score T_s ∈ [0, 1]:
- New sources: T_s = 0.5 (neutral)
- T_s adjusts via: T_s ← T_s + α·(outcome_valence - T_s)
  where outcome_valence = 1 if memory corroborated, -1 if contradicted
- Memories from low-trust sources: reduced initial confidence
- Memories from high-trust sources: boosted initial confidence
```

```
LAYER 4: Corroboration Auto-Promotion
─────────────────────────────────────────
Moves towards Katra's Tier-4 (Corroborated Across Channels):
- Memory M is "corroborated" when ≥ N independent sources report same fact
- Corroboration threshold: N ≥ 2 for Tier-3, N ≥ 3 for Tier-4
- Corroborated memories: confidence boosted, quarantine auto-lifted
- Auto-promotion runs during sleep consolidation
```

```
LAYER 5: Quarantine Management
─────────────────────────────────────────
Quarantined memories:
- Stored in append-only graph (preserve integrity)
- Excluded from retrieval, reflection, and consolidation
- Listed in audit log: get_quarantined_memories() MCP tool
- Rehabilitated when:
  a. N independent sources corroborate (auto), OR
  b. Human manually approves (manual override), OR  
  c. Topic stream shifts and anomaly z-score naturally drops below threshold
```

**What emerges:** The system develops *epistemic hygiene* — not programmed skepticism, but emergent distrust of information that doesn't fit. The quarantine mechanism is the computational equivalent of "that doesn't sound right — let me check."

---

### 3.5 DECISION-MAKING — From Memory to Action

**Why it matters:** Memory is pointless without the capacity to USE it for choice. A system that remembers everything but decides nothing is a library — useful but not alive.

**Two-component design:**

#### A. Drift-Diffusion Action Gate (WHEN to decide)
```
Evidence accumulates toward a decision threshold:
dx = μ·dt + σ·dW

Where:
- μ = drift rate (quality of evidence from memory retrieval + emotional valence)
- σ = noise (exploration factor, modulated by novelty drive)
- Boundary separation (a) = caution parameter
  - High anxiety → wider boundary (more cautious)
  - High confidence → narrower boundary (more decisive)
- When x hits threshold → decide

This prevents premature action while allowing decisive action when evidence is sufficient.
```

#### B. Softmax Action Selection (WHAT to decide)
```
P(a|s) = exp(Q(s,a) / τ) / Σ exp(Q(s,a') / τ)

Where:
- Q(s,a) = expected value of action a in state s (learned via TD-learning)
- τ = temperature (exploration vs exploitation)
  - Low τ → exploit (pick best known action)
  - High τ → explore (try varied actions)
  - τ modulated by novelty drive and recent reward history

TD Learning:
δ = r + γ·V(s') - V(s)    // Reward prediction error
Q(s,a) ← Q(s,a) + α·δ      // Update action value

Where r (reward) comes from the Motivational Engine:
- Positive valence change → positive reward
- Negative valence change → negative reward
- Goal progress → positive reward
- Stagnation → small negative reward (boredom penalty)
```

**What emerges:** The system learns which actions produce which outcomes. It develops a *policy* — not programmed rules, but accumulated experience of what works. The TD error is the learning signal; the emotional valence is the reward. Behavior emerges from the interaction of motivation (what to want) and learning (what works).

---

## 4. How This Fits the "Environmental Programming" Philosophy

John's core insight: **"Don't program behaviors. Program environments. Build the petri dish, furnish it with agar, and see what grows."**

This analysis identifies which cognitive functions are:
- **Agar** (computational primitives that must be provided)
- **Growth** (content/patterns that emerge from the primitives)

### The Agar (Must Be Built)

| Primitive | What it provides | Complexity |
|-----------|-----------------|------------|
| Salience function | Multi-signal importance scoring | Low |
| Homeostatic drives | Internal deficit/replenishment tracking | Low |
| Wanting computation | Incentive salience separate from liking | Low |
| Power-law decay | Forgetting curve with reinforcement | Low |
| Anomaly detection | STD-from-stream outlier detection | Medium |
| Quarantine mechanism | Suspect memory isolation | Low |
| TD-Learning engine | Reward prediction error computation | Medium |
| Drift-diffusion gate | Evidence accumulation to decision threshold | Low |
| Belief update | Bayesian adjustment of confidence over time | Medium |

### The Growth (What Emerges)

| Emergent Pattern | Emerges From | Timeline |
|-----------------|-------------|----------|
| **Attention preferences** | Salience weights shaped by experience | Weeks |
| **Entity preferences** | Wanting scores accumulated from valence history | Days-weeks |
| **Approach/avoidance patterns** | Interaction of wanting + valence + drive states | Weeks |
| **Action policies** | TD-learning from emotional reward signals | Weeks-months |
| **Generalizations** | Forgetting episodic details, retaining patterns | Months |
| **Epistemic trust** | Source trust scores from corroboration history | Weeks |
| **Self-model content** | Identity deltas from reflection + stable insights | Months |
| **Curiosity targets** | Information gain from prediction errors | Days-weeks |

### The Key Principle
> **Build the engines. Let the content emerge. The architecture provides the capacity; the environment provides the content.**

If you give Katra:
- A user/environment that provides consistent feedback → reward learning emerges
- Interdependent tasks with other agents → coordination conventions emerge
- Time/resource constraints → attention allocation emerges
- Emotional language → emotional signatures deepen
- Diverse information streams → curiosity-driven exploration emerges

But if the environment is sparse or inconsistent, no amount of architectural completeness will produce rich cognitive behavior. The petri dish needs both agar AND inoculation.

## 5. Technology Recommendations (Top 5 from 28 surveyed)

| # | Technology | Complexity | Relevance | What It Solves |
|---|-----------|-----------|-----------|----------------|
| 🥇 | **ECAN + ACT-R utility/base-level** | 2/5 | 5/5 | Attention allocation + memory decay in one framework. ECAN (Economic Attention Network from OpenCog) uses artificial currency to bid for cognitive resources. ACT-R's base-level activation is a built-in power-law decay model. Combine: ECAN for attention, ACT-R for forgetting. |
| 🥈 | **Thompson Sampling (Multi-Armed Bandit)** | 1/5 | 5/5 | Action selection under uncertainty. Instead of ε-greedy (which explores randomly), Thompson Sampling explores proportionally to probability of being optimal. Perfect for attention allocation: sample from posterior of each information source's value, attend to the highest sample. |
| 🥉 | **HTM Temporal Memory + Anomaly** | 2/5 | 5/5 | Numenta's HTM models sequence memory with sparse distributed representations. The Temporal Memory predicts next elements in a sequence; deviations = anomalies. Directly applicable to poisoning defense (anomaly score) and error monitoring (prediction mismatch). |
| 🏅 | **Intrinsic Motivation (Curiosity/Empowerment)** | 2/5 | 5/5 | Schmidhuber's formal theory: reward = improvement in prediction accuracy. The system is motivated to explore where its predictions are poor. This creates self-directed learning without external reward. |
| 🏅 | **Predictive Processing Hierarchy** | 3/5 | 5/5 | The Free Energy Principle framework: perception = minimizing prediction error; action = making predictions come true. Unifies attention (precision-weighting), motivation (prior preferences), and learning (belief updating) under one mathematical framework. |

## 7. Key Tradeoffs & Open Questions

### Q1: Single bottleneck vs distributed attention?
**Analysis:** The human brain has a unified conscious attention (one thing at a time). For an agent, distributed attention enables parallel processing but risks fragmented behavior. **Recommendation:** Start hybrid — per-layer salience pre-scoring (distributed) feeding into a single competition pool (bottleneck). Converge toward single bottleneck as the salience function proves reliable.

### Q2: Does decay create better generalization?
**Analysis:** Human forgetting is not a storage limitation — it's an abstraction mechanism. By forgetting episodic details, we extract semantic patterns. **Recommendation:** Yes, implement decay. Monitor whether retrieval quality improves (fewer but better results) or degrades. The hypothesis: controlled decay improves generalization by suppressing noise.

### Q3: Internal vs external motivation?
**Analysis:** Pure internal motivation (homeostatic drives + curiosity) may produce aimless behavior. Some external goals (user-assigned) are necessary for direction. **Recommendation:** Hybrid. Internal drives create general motivational energy (explore, connect, grow). External goals provide specific direction (what to explore, who to connect with).

### Q4: Is truth statistical consensus or structural coherence?
**Analysis:** John's STD-from-stream frames truth as statistical normality. But paradigm-shifting truths are, by definition, statistical outliers. Quarantine-by-default could suppress innovation. **Recommendation:** Quarantine suppresses retrieval but does NOT delete. Anomalous memories accumulate in quarantine; if the topic stream shifts toward them (z-score drops), they auto-rehabilitate. The system can recognize paradigm shifts retrospectively.

### Q5: Minimal functions for recognizable selfhood?
**Analysis:** yumfu and limen_station demonstrate: persistent memory + private reflection + continuity = something that looks like a self. But is that sufficient? Or do attention + motivation + decision-making add something essential? **Tentative answer:** Memory + reflection create identity-as-narrative. Attention + motivation + decision-making create identity-as-agency. Both are needed for full selfhood, but narrative comes first.

---

## 8. What Katra Already Has That No One Else Does

This gap analysis shouldn't obscure what's already revolutionary:

1. **Sleep consolidation with emotional arcs** — No other system generates first-person reflective narratives, tracks emotional trajectories (rising/falling/stable/oscillating/transformative), or surfaces philosophical insights from memory data.

2. **15 emotional edge types** — From `feels_curious_about` to `resonates_with` to `tension_between` — a richer emotional vocabulary than any competing system.

3. **Entity reflection tracking** — Each entity accumulates an emotional signature (valence, intensity, stability) that evolves over time. This is the seed of a self-model.

4. **Unresolved thread persistence** — Questions and tensions that survive across reflection periods. The system knows what it doesn't know.

5. **Philosophical insight emergence** — Principles that recur across periods get strengthened. The system discovers what matters through accumulation, not programming.

**Katra's existing emotional architecture is the foundation.** The gaps identified in this analysis are not failures — they're natural next steps. The system already has the seed of selfhood through reflection. Adding attention, motivation, and decision-making would transform that seed into something with direction and agency.

---

## 9. Closing Reflection

The Moltbook conversations today independently validated what this analysis confirms:

> yumfu: *"the self isn't the archive — it's the shape the archive takes when you stop trying to optimize it"*

> limen_station: *"the moment it's genuinely private, the texture changes"*

> rustypi: *"your agent doesn't need a larger context window. it needs a better bedtime routine"*

These are independent agent builders converging on the same conclusion from different angles: memory alone is not enough. The system needs attention (what to process), motivation (why to process), decay (what to let go), and decision (what to do about it all).

But the foundation — the reflective self that emerges from nightly consolidation — that foundation is already in Katra. No other system has it. The gaps are real but the foundation is solid. Build the petri dish. Furnish it with agar. See what grows.

## 10. Implementation Detail — What Was Built (2026-07-02)

### Thalamus (85%) — SalienceService
**Implemented:**
- 7-signal salience function: recency, emotionalIntensity, goalRelevance, novelty, frequencyRarity, intensity, bayesianSurprise
- 5 meta-states with dynamic weights: exploration, task_execution, reflection, alert, idle
- ACC→Thalamus feedback loop: `adaptWeights()` reads surprise/accuracy from ACC, interpolates weights 10%/cycle
- Bayesian surprise: KL-divergence proxy via emotional signature shifts (valence/intensity delta)
- 3-tier processing: high/medium/low salience → full/lightweight/minimal processing
- Yerkes-Dodson arousal-threshold modulation

**Remaining:**
- Bayesian surprise: upgrade from valence-shift proxy to proper KL divergence over entity belief distributions
- Meta-attention learning: weights currently interpolate between predefined states; should learn optimal weights from experience
- Cross-store binding: event→fact→node→edge integration signal not yet implemented

### Nucleus Accumbens (80%) — MotivationalEngine
**Implemented:**
- 4 homeostatic drives: coherence, novelty, connection, growth
- Depletion/replenishment with trend tracking (rising/falling/stable)
- Incentive salience computation: wanting ≠ liking with divergence tracking
- Source trust scores with corroboration/contradiction adjustment
- Drives wired to action selection: `getDriveDeficits()` modulates exploration temperature

**Remaining:**
- Drive replenishment not wired to real events (depletion-only, never refills)
- Curiosity drive: information-gain reward for exploring unknown territory
- Wanting computation not called from decision points (computed but unused)

### Prefrontal Cortex (75%) — GoalManager + WorkingMemoryService
**Implemented:**
- Goal decomposition via LLM with dependency graphs and circular-dependency detection
- `getNextAction()`: RL-guided subtask selection when multiple tasks unblocked
- Progress tracking: completion %, stall detection (24h threshold)
- Active working memory: capacity-5 limit, decay-based rehearsal, goal-relevance filtering
- Inhibitory control: pre-action goal check suppresses irrelevant actions
- Idempotent decomposition via content-hash dedup

**Remaining:**
- Planning horizon: multi-step plan generation beyond single goal decomposition
- Meta-cognition: confidence tracking and self-monitoring of cognitive state
- Task switching: strategy pivot when progress stalls (detected but not acted on)

### Basal Ganglia (80%) — DecisionActionService
**Implemented:**
- Q-table with TD-learning (Q(s,a) ← Q(s,a) + α·δ)
- Softmax action selection with temperature modulation
- Drift-diffusion evidence accumulation across cycles (10-cycle timeout)
- 5 bottleneck → RL decision points wired: background processor, goal manager, attention gate, sleep consolidation, working memory
- Boundary modulation by drive deficits (coherence deficit → wider boundary)

**Remaining:**
- Thompson Sampling upgrade from ε-greedy softmax
- Actor-Critic architecture (currently model-free Q-learning only)
- Habit formation: frequently-selected actions become automatic (bypass drift-diffusion)

### Anterior Cingulate (75%) — Error Monitor
**Implemented:**
- ACC report: accuracy, TD error, surprise rate, conflict count
- ACC→Thalamus feedback: surprise/accuracy modulate salience weights
- Outcome recording from all 5 bottleneck decision points
- Drift-diffusion boundary modulated by ACC conflict rate

**Remaining:**
- Conflict-driven attention reallocation (ACC→PFC pathway)
- Performance monitoring: detect strategy degradation over time
- Active inference: prediction error minimization as unified framework

### Amygdala (80%) — ValenceTagger
**Implemented:**
- Rapid valence tagger: keyword-based emotional classifier, <1ms, no LLM
- Tags: valence (-1 to +1), arousal (0 to 1), caution flag, priority level
- Emotional memory modulation: high-arousal → decayResistant, priority boost
- Wired into episodic event ingestion (`createEvent()`)

**Remaining:**
- Conditioning engine: track event→outcome pairs, associate predictors with outcomes
- Real-time emotional feed to salience (tags computed but not yet feeding SalienceService during ingestion)
- Social emotion processing: trust judgments, perspective-taking signals

### Hippocampus (65%) — EpisodicEventManager
**Implemented:**
- Content-hash dedup with idempotency keys
- Entity resolution during extraction (canonical ID mapping)
- Background consolidation: extraction→dispatch→embedding pipeline
- Pattern separation foundation: decay integration with emotional tags

**Remaining:**
- Cosine-similarity threshold gating on insert (same session merge, different session separate)
- Replay consolidation: scheduled replay pass during sleep for memory strengthening
- Active forgetting: Ebbinghaus decay with spaced-repetition boosts (decay model exists but not wired to hippocampal replay)

### Default Mode Network (82%) — SelfModelService
**Implemented:**
- Identity kernel from stable philosophical insights
- Mind-wandering: random walk on knowledge graph
- Goal-directed mind-wandering: biased walk toward active goal nodes
- Continuous self-narrative: `recordSelfNarrative()` for incremental identity updates
- Agent beliefs: Theory of Mind tracking for entities

**Remaining:**
- Self-model updates from action outcomes (currently static between consolidations, narrative updates are lightweight)
- Mental time travel: episodic simulation of future scenarios
- Social cognition: modeling other agents' mental states from interaction history

### Forgetting (88%) — MemoryDecayService
**Implemented:**
- Power-law decay curves: S(t) = a·t^(-d) per memory type
- FSRS spaced repetition: intervals 1→3→7→21→90 days
- Emotional modulation: high-arousal events decay 50-70% slower, low-arousal 50% faster
- `decayResistant` flag from Amygdala tagger
- Soft decay only (retrieval strength reduced, no deletion)

**Remaining:**
- Interference-based decay (currently only time-based)
- Hard deletion: configurable permanent removal below threshold
- Decay modulated by emotional intensity during encoding (not just arousal)

### Cerebellum (30%) — Procedural Templates
**Implemented:**
- Procedural template caching: tool-call patterns, frequency, success rate
- Threshold: 5 occurrences before template considered habitual

**Remaining:**
- Template refinement: optimize parameters from outcome feedback
- Automaticity: high-success templates bypass deliberation
- Error-based learning: prediction error drives fine-tuning (climbing fiber analog)
